  description:  The mechanisms underlying resistance to neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (nICRT) in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain poorly understood. Through a single-arm phase II trial (n = 22) with 44.4-month median follow-up, we observed a significant survival disparity: patients achieving major pathologic response (MPR) exhibited superior 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with no recurrence in MPR patients versus 71.4% recurrence in non-major pathological response (NMPR) patients (HR = 17.69, 95% CI 2.25-139.20, p = 0.0063). Integrating single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing and functional validation, we identified a PRDM1+ malignant cell subcluster enriched in NMPR patients and associated with treatment resistance. These cells exhibit strong lipid peroxidation characteristics, a state linked to the transcriptional activation of CTSB and MFSD12 mediated by PRDM1. This state renders the PRDM1+ malignant cell cluster more susceptible to ferroptosis induction. PRDM1+ cells further recruited immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) through IL1A-IL1R2 interactions and activated lipid-metabolizing TREM2+ macrophages via CD47-SIRPA signaling, fostering an immune-evasive microenvironment. Conversely, MPR patients displayed expanded cytotoxic T-effector clones with enhanced tumor-killing capacity. Our findings identify PRDM1 as a key factor associated with nICRT resistance and suggest that targeting ferroptosis pathways or disrupting PRDM1+ cell-mediated immune suppression may represent a viable strategy in ESCC. Clinical trial registration number: NCT03940001.

  description:  While dual KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition shows promise in treating KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), resistance remains a major challenge. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived organoids and xenografts, as well as clinical specimens, we discover that colorectal tumors surviving combined KRAS and EGFR inhibition acquire a Paneth-like cell state-a secretory lineage typically confined to the intestinal crypt. Lineage tracing reveals that CRC cells evade dual therapy by transitioning into a Paneth-like state. Through integrated transcriptomic analysis and CRISPR genetic screening, we identify SMAD1 as a key regulator of this lineage plasticity, promoting resistance by directly activating FGFR3. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGFR3 prevents the Paneth-like transition, restores drug sensitivity, and synergizes with KRAS-EGFR inhibition across multiple preclinical models. These findings reveal that the SMAD1-FGFR3 axis triggers Paneth-like plasticity to drive KRAS-EGFR dual therapy resistance in CRC and highlight FGFR3 blockade as a promising strategy to overcome plasticity-driven drug tolerance.

  description:  The quality control and filtration of cancer somatic mutations (CAMs), including the elimination of false positives due to technical bias and the selection of key mutation candidates, are crucial steps for downstream analysis in cancer genomics. However, due to diverse needs and the lack of standardized filtering criteria, the filtering strategies applied vary from study to study, often resulting in reduced efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility. Here, we present CaMutQC, a heuristic quality control and soft-filtering R/Bioconductor package designed specifically for CAMs. CaMutQC enables users to remove false positive mutations, select potential mutation candidates, and estimate Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) with a single line of code, using either default or customized parameters. A filter report and a code log can also be generated after the filtration process to facilitate reproducibility and comparison. The application of CaMutQC to a Whole-exome Sequencing (WES) benchmark dataset demonstrated its strong capability by eliminating 85.55 % of false positive Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) while retaining 90.72 % of true positive SNVs. Additionally, an additional 11.56 % of true positive SNVs were rescued through CaMutQC's built-in union strategy. Similar results were observed for Insertions and Deletions (INDELs). CaMutQC is freely available through Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/CaMutQC/ under the GPL v3 license.

  description:  Small cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCCE) is an aggressive and rare neuroendocrine malignancy with poor prognosis. Here, we firstly performed single-cell transcriptional profiling derived from 10 SCCE patients, with normal esophageal mucosa, adjacent non-malignant tissue and tumors from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) as reference. We observed enrichment of activated regulatory T cells and an angiogenesis-induced niche existed in SCCE compared with ESCC, revealing an immune suppressive and vessel-induced tumor microenvironment (TME) in SCCE. Totally, we identified five TME ecotypes (EC1 ~ 5). Notably, EC1 was highly enriched in SCCE, associating with molecular subtyping and survival outcomes. To dissecting heterogeneity of epithelium in SCCE, we constructed eight transcriptional metaprograms (MPs) that underscored significant heterogeneity of SCCE. High expression of MP5 was linked to neuroendocrine phenotype and poor clinical survival. Collectively, these results, for the first time, systematically deciphered the TME and epithelial heterogeneity of SCCE and provided evidences that SCCE patients might benefit from anti-angiogenesis therapy.

  description:  The role of gut microbiota, especially viruses, in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the interplay between gut microbiota and CRC development. We developed a viral/bacterial sequence analysis pipeline to reanalyze gut metagenomic datasets from eight CRC studies. A multisample co-occurrence network was constructed to delineate microbiota species interconnections. Our analysis confirmed dysbiosis in CRC patients and revealed enrichment of viral species, particularly those hosted by Lactococcus and Escherichia. These viruses were identified as central hubs in the multikingdom interaction network. We developed a network-based model using single sample networks (SSN) that distinguished CRC patients from controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. Models combining relative abundance and SSN assessment achieved an AUC of 0.97, outperforming SSN-based models without viral data. This study highlights the crucial role of viruses in the gut microbiome network and their potential as targets for CRC prevention and intervention. Our approach offers a new perspective on noninvasive diagnostic criteria for CRC.

  description:  Genetic variants can affect protein function by driving aberrant subcellular localization. However, comprehensive analysis of how mutations promote tumor progression by influencing nuclear localization is currently lacking. Here, we systematically characterize potential shuttling-attacking mutations (SAMs) across cancers through developing the deep learning model pSAM for the ab initio decoding of the sequence determinants of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Leveraging cancer mutations across 11 cancer types, we find that SAMs enrich functional genetic variations and critical genes in cancer. We experimentally validate a dozen SAMs, among which R14M in PTEN, P255L in CHFR, etc. are identified to disrupt the nuclear localization signals through interfering their interactions with importins. Further studies confirm that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling altered by SAMs in PTEN and CHFR rewire the downstream signaling and eliminate their function of tumor suppression. Thus, this study will help to understand the molecular traits of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and their dysfunctions mediated by genetic variants.

  description:  Doublets are a key confounding factor in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, as they can interfere with differential expression analysis and disrupt developmental trajectories. However, due to the randomness of the algorithms, most doublet removal methods still leave a certain proportion of doublets after application. In this study, we proposed a multi-round doublet removal (MRDR) strategy, that ran the algorithm in cycles multiple times to effectively reduce randomness while enhancing the effectiveness of doublet removal. We evaluated the MRDR strategy in 14 real-world datasets, 29 barcoded scRNA-seq datasets, and 106 synthetic datasets with four popular doublet detection tools, including DoubletFinder, cxds, bcds, and hybrid. We found that in real-world datasets, the DoubletFinder had a better performance in MRDR strategy compared to a single removal of doublets and the recall rate improved by 50 % for two rounds of doublet removal compared to one round, and the performance of the other three doublet algorithms improved the ROC by about 0.04. In barcoded scRNA-seq datasets, we found that using cxds for two rounds of doublet removal yielded the best results. Subsequently, in simulated datasets, we proved that the multi-round removal strategy was more effective in removing doublets than a single removal, with cxds showing the best results when applied twice, and the ROC of the four methods during the two rounds of removal improved by at least 0.05 compared to single removal. Finally, compared to running the algorithm once, we found that the MRDR strategy was more beneficial for differential gene expression analysis and cell trajectory inference when using default analysis parameters. Overall, we proved that the MRDR strategy was more effective in removing doublets and advantageous for downstream analyses, and the strategy could be incorporated into the standard analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq experiments and recommend using cxds to remove doublets through two rounds of algorithm iteration.
