Our new ecDNA allocation algorithm **GCAP** is now live! [linc](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45479-6). Congratulations to Shixiang Wang! GCAP enables determination of ecDNA status from whole-exome sequencing (WES) datasets. Using GCAP, we further reveal that ecDNA may serve as a promising biomarker for ICI treatment in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.
